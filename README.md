# Detect_Mask
COVID-19

This project was presented at the Internet of Things contest held in high school.

## Introduce About Our Project

We Planing To Develop The Detect Mask Machine With Raspberry Pi 3b+ 👀

It's because the corona is too big right now.

So We always Wear The Mask everywhere But Some people Take Off the Mask in Public Place 🤬

Therefore, the project was carried out in hopes that people could wear masks well


## Introduce About Our Code

1. The 'Dataset' folder was used to teach us how to recognize masks. 

2. The 'face_detector' folder was beforehand train model by Tensorflow.kr

3. 'Train_Mask_Detector.py' is Real Train Mask Python Code With Tensorflow Module and Sklearn Module + Keras

4. 'Detect_Mask_video.py' is Detecting Wearing Mask or Not. We Develop this code with openCV Library

5. 'PushingBoxAPI.py' is If User is Take off the mask and inform to owner of public place 👻 
    
   - This Code demand Personal API Key So I annonate This code. If You Want Using 'PushingBoxAPI.py' , Please tell in 'Issues' And I Introduce About How to use it.


## Difficulty Of Processing About This Project

When we first planned this project, We Use the Hardware of Raspberry Pi W Zero.

But it has a small specfication. 🤦‍♀️

So We Change the Hardware Of Raspberrypi 3b+

And This project requires quite a lot of specifications, So Raspberry Pi 3b+'s fever was too severe.

If I had I lot of Money, I will use latte panda or More Specifications Hardware Things instead of raspberry pi.

Lastly, We have Extra difficulty.

It's about openCV Library.

openCV Library was developed in Intel, So openCV is unoptimized in 'arm' AP ( this is Rapsberry pi's AP ) 🙄


## Final Comment 

We Process this Project, We can feel lot of Things.

This is First Project Of Machine Learning, So I was very worried.

But I Can Learn Many Things by Google 😂

#### And Our Team Was Win The Internet Of Things Contest!

Lastly, Please Wear The Mask At Outside................ 👻

Thank You for Reading!

## Warning

#### Please read the requirements.txt And install all the packages👀
